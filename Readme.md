### Prerequisite

You will need to install node to run the code. I am not using fancy node js features, but node 16+ is recommended.

### How to run my solution?
If you wish to run the standard answer, run the command: 

```zsh
node standard.js
```

For Advanced version run 

```zsh
node advanced.js
```
